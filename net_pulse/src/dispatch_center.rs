// TODO: Implement methods for message types that implement `Closable` (should include `shutdown_channel` to close a specific channel and `shutdown_all` to close all channels).

// TODO LATER: Implement `Drop` for receivers to enable automatic unsubscription. This requires creating a wrapper containing a shared reference to the `DispatchCenter` to call `unsubscribe`.
// TODO LATER: Add a wait-for-closing notifier. This should behave similarly to the creation waiters, but for destruction events.
// TODO LATER: Add the ability to create `WritingHandler` directly from user input.
// TODO LATER: Add the possibility to choose specific tasks to wait for in `WritingHandler`.
// TODO LATER: Improve error handling in `WritingHandler` by allowing identification of which sender failed.
// TODO LATER: Allow the user to pass this as an argument to certain functions (not yet implemented).
